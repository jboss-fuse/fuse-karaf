    <!--
        This Blueprint XML shows other _deployment_ method for connection factory configuration.
        With this method, we use pax-jms-config 1.0.0+, but without a need to use configuration admin factory PID
        We need:
         - jms feature
         - pax-jms-config feature
         - pax-jms-artemis feature
         - pax-jms-pool-transx feature

        This Blueprint XML can be directly dropped to ${karaf.home}/deploy or archived in typical /OSGI-INF/blueprint
        directory and installed as normal bundle.

        We configure broker-specific (XA) connection factory directly as Blueprint bean
        (as it was recommended with Fuse 6.x) and specify some properties that'll make this connection factory eligible
        for "wrapping" by pax-jms-config (since 1.0.0).
